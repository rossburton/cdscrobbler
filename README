CD Scrobbler, a CD upload tool for Audioscrobbler/Last.fm

Copyright (C) 2005 Ross Burton <ross@burtonini.com>
Licensed under the GPL, version 2 or greater.

A small tool to either sent track data to Audioscrobbler, taking the data from
either the current CD (in the computer's CD drive) or a MusicBrainz album ID.
Audioscrobbler is told that you just finished listening to the CD.

To configure it create ~/.cdscrobbler with the following format:

[CDScrobbler]
username=...
password=...

If you don't do this, cdscrobbler.py won't work.

To use it, do this:

$ cdscrobbler.py

to send the current CD's track data.  Or this:

$ cdscrobber.py 5f5f04ef-882b-498f-8e3b-973a82573cf3

to sent the track data from a particular album on MusicBrainz.
